## Gaurav Parthasarathy.

Hi, I am final year PhD student at ETH Zurich in computer science. 
My main advisor is [Peter MÃ¼ller](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=112017) and my second advisor is [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/).

I am very interested in the question: "How can we develop trustworthy software programs?".
A "trustworthy software program" is a software program that works as originally intended (e.g., does not crash, computes only correct results, does not leak sensitive information).
