## Gaurav Parthasarathy.

Hi, I am a final year doctoral student at ETH Zurich in computer science. 
My main advisor is [Peter MÃ¼ller](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=112017) and my second advisor is [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/).

I am very interested in the question: How can we develop software programs that are guaranteed to work as intended (for instance, do not crash, compute only correct results, do not leak sensitive information)? 
In my doctorate, I have been exploring answers to this question using *formal program verification* techniques based on mathematical foundations with which one can formally prove that programs behave as expected.
In particular, I have developed general program verification approaches and have applied these to two existing complex programs that are widely used in the program verification community: [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) and [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie/).
Both of these programs are *automated program verifiers*: Given a specification for an input program, these tools automatically check that the input program satisfies this specification.
That means my work formally verifies verifiers.
A distinguishing aspect of my work compared to prior research is that my work proves formal results about *existing program verifier implementations* used in practice with all their intricacies, instead of considering idealised verifier implementations that are not used in practice.

After completing my doctorate this year, I am planning to transition from academia to industry, where I hope to be working in an environment that values software quality.
