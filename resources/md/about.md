## Gaurav Parthasarathy

Hi, I recently completed my PhD in computer science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Peter MÃ¼ller](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=112017) (main advisor) and [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) (second advisor).

I like to develop *trustworthy* software and I use systematic approaches to increase confidence that software is indeed trustworthy (for instance, does not crash and computes only correct results).
I am interested in a wide range of techniques to establish trustworthiness.
These range from advanced techniques such as program verification and static analysis to more lightweight techniques such as testing, setting up effective CI/CD pipelines, writing clean and well-documented code, and leveraging programming language features.

My PhD research is closely tied to trustworthy software: I focused on developing techniques for formally verifying the correctness of *automatic program verifiers*, which are programs that automatically verify programs.
In short, I verified verifiers.
A distinguishing aspect of my research is that it considers *existing* implementations of automatic program verifiers *used in practice*.

I am currently looking for opportunities in industry, where I would like to develop high-quality software in an environment that values trustworthiness.
