Hi, I recently completed my PhD in computer science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Peter MÃ¼ller](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=112017) (main advisor) and [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) (second advisor).

I am very interested in the question: How can we develop software programs that are guaranteed to behave as intended (for instance, do not crash, compute only correct results, and do not leak sensitive information)? 
In my PhD, I explored answers to this question using *formal program verification* techniques, which allow one to formally verify that programs behave as intended.
In particular, my PhD research focused on developing techniques for formally verifying the correctness of *automatic program verifiers*, which are programs that automatically verify input programs.
That means I focused on verifying programs, which themselves verify programs.
A distinguishing aspect of my research is that it considers *existing* implementations of automatic program verifiers *used in practice*.

I am currently planning to transition from academia to industry, where I would like to work in an environment that values software quality.
